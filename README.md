# edwards_algorithm

An algorithm for SageMath to compute generators of the Veech group of a translation surface when the group is a lattice.  Otherwise a subset of the Veech group is returned.  This algorithm is from Brandon Edwards's 2017 PhD dissertation, `A New Algorithm for Computing the Veech Group of a Translation Surface' (https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/0v838415s?locale=en).
We build on the flatsurf package of SageMath developed by Delecroix and Hooper (https://github.com/videlec/sage-flatsurf).
